      I''m not sure... maybe something smaller?'

      The island inhabited more than 5000 people. I suppose
      it is quite a bit bigger than what the briefing made us believe.'

      You''re not allowed to know too much after all.'

      Of course. Because that is such a good way a preforming

      we are tasked to do. "

      Well said. The only reason you guys are here is for
      a second a opinion after all, and you all signed the contract to do so. '

      Michael, you have audio log duties-'

      Dear Gerald,


      I know the rumours have been spreading,
      and I am sad to confirm them. There is an evil that is feasting on the misery
      of the town. You know how these things spread throughout the community, and
      one of the most wellknown theories running around at this moment is the rumours
      of a cult.'
    - Supposedly a cult in our midst is worshipping the devil and summoning its creatures
      to invest this town. Whether I believe this or not remains to be seen, but
      the result is all the same. People are fearfull. They're feeding the creature
      without even knowing it.
    - 'I managed to secure a spot on the last boat leaving the island. I am headed
      towards London to try my fortune over there now that Caroline is gone. I hope
      to hear from you once I have settled. I will stay in touch.


      Kind Regards,


      J,
      Bennett'

      Dear Mirian,


      I say with deep regret I must
      cut ties with you immediately as things are going terribly at the town.


      I
      see more and more souls step into the church everyday, touched by the devil''s
      beast. The priest is preaching about demons having been let into the town,
      feeding on the guilty minds and I cannot help but be counted amongst them.'
    - 'I cannot put what we have over the fate of the town. Though I am sad, I shan''t
      be sorry.


      Yours truly,


      Julia'
